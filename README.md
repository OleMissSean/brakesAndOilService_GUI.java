Programming Project 5 for CSci 112.

CSCI 112: Programming Project 5

Due Date: July 23rd by 11:59 pm

You will create the Bob's Oil & Brakes customer form from the image below.

You need to add:
  - A combo box (New customer, Repeat customer).
  - Two radio buttons (Under Warranty, No Warranty).
  - A save button (see additional requirements below).
  - An exit button.
  
You need to change: (This will require you to search the net, it's not in the book.)
  - The color of "auto Repair Form", "Vehicle Owner", "Total", and prices to blue.
  - Change the bacground color of the calculate, save, and exit buttons (it's up to you as to what color you want them,      but if it's too dark to read the text within the buttons, you'll have to change that as well).
  - Make the check box text *Bold* (i.e.: Brake pads, Oil change).
  
The save button:
  I want you to save the data to a text file. You will have to Google this probably. Look into the fileWriter and          bufferWriter or just Google "java save to a text file" there are several answers in stack overflow. To do this you will   need to create a string from the data then save it.
  This is for extra credit! If you can't (or don't want to ) it won't count against you. The button still needs to be      there.

The layout is up to you. so long as the "Auto Repair Form" is at the top of the GUI.

*No late programs will be accepted. If your program does not compile, it will not receive any credit. If you need help, come see me during my office hours, make an appointment with me, or speak to a TA in the labs on Sunday - Thursday from 5:00 - 8:00 p.m.
